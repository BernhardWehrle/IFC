An element that occurs at a location along a linear element

> NOTE&nbsp; 19148:2012 defines a Linearly located event as “an occurrence along a feature of an attributevalue or another feature.” For IFC Road a similar approach has been used to define elementsalong the alignment of a road at locations where design parameterschange. Currently, superelevation and width aredefined using this mechanism. However, the model allows for adding other design parameters in a similar fashion.

> NOTE&nbsp; Since EventElement is defined as a subclass of Product, it may be contained in spatial (project) structureelements such as traffic lanes.
